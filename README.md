A schema-less revisioning database project built on [Mongoid](https://github.com/mongodb/mongoid)

## Getting Started

Install cooper from the command prompt

  `gem install cooper`

## Usage

```ruby
require 'cooper'

# Frameworks usually manage this step on their own
Mongoid.load!('/path/to/config/mongoid.yml', :environment)

class Record
  include Cooper::Document

  revision_field :key
end

record = Record.new(key: 1)

record.save
p record.key
#=> 1

record.update_attributes(key: 2)
p record.key
#=> 2

record.checkout(1)
p record.key
#=> 1
```
    
## Features

Cooper::Document behaves like a Mongoid::Document

It adds the capabilities of checking out declared revision fields

It uses Redis on port 6379 to get the current revision count

## Road Map

* Persist revision count from mongodb
* Allow Redis configuration

##Â Tests

`rake` will run all tests

`rake spec:features` will run against mongodb (configuration is located at `spec/support/mongoid.yml`)

`rake spec:unit` runs tests in isolation
